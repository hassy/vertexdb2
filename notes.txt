The TokyoCabinet extension for Lua didn't build out-of-the-box on my OSX 10.5. To fix:

1. Remove Lua installed via MacPorts, and install it from the official tarball from lua.org
2. After running ./confugure for the TokyoCabinet extension, edit the Makefile manually:
  * add -llua to the list afte LIBS=
